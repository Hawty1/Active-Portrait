# Active-Portrait
Css-Art in a picture 

11.12.2020 - 
The idea is to create a picture which has elements that can be activated through sliders next to the picture. At the moment I'm simply erasing the style.opacity to blend in the elements as you can see with the clouds and the sun-light. But the goal is to make it more "active". 

Below some ideas I want to add  

* Core Elements (always visible)
 * A Tree
 * Protagonists (human or animal)

The slider effects:

* Grass-Density  
  * more grass will 
  * some flowers between grass
  * tree with better visible crown (maybe a hole in the tree is getting visible)  
 
* Weather-effects
  * blowing wind
  * grass will be moving (maybe a flower is growing if a value is reached?)
  * Tree is moving 
  * some sort of wind-spiral is visible
 
More Ideas will be added.
